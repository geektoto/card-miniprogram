 Example of how to whitelist crypto algorithms. Strengthen or weaken the whitelist according to
 the policy or compliance regime that you want to follow. The algorithms in this file are just
 an example and should not be considered sufficient.
 You may also want to add stubs for Mac, and KeyAgreement here.
